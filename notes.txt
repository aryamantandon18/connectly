npm i @prisma/client
npx prisma init
npx prisma migrate dev --name init  
npx prisma generate //after creating the models    (We need to stop our server to run this)

npx prisma studio // runs on loaclhost:5555
npm install next-auth @next-auth/prisma-adapter

The useForm hook is defined after this return statement. If the isMounted condition is false, the useForm hook will not be executed, leading to a change in the order of hooks between renders.

everytime if we do any changes in our prisma schema , then run these 3 commands
npx prisma migrate reset  // to remove entire db
npx prisma generate  // when the server is stopped
npx prisma db push  // this will remove all the existing data from db
